# Mini-mars-rover
This project is a small, Arduino-powered robotic rover inspired by real Mars exploration vehicles. It features basic obstacle detection, motor control, and a simple 3D-printed chassis. The entire design, including circuit layout and Arduino code, was built and simulated in Tinkercad.

## Project Overview

The Mars Mini Rover is intended as an educational robotics project. It introduces core concepts in:

- Arduino programming
- Basic electronics (motors, sensors, power supply)
- Circuit simulation using Tinkercad

The rover moves forward and uses an ultrasonic sensor to detect and avoid obstacles.

## Components Used

- Arduino Uno
- L298N Motor Driver
- 2x DC Motors with Wheels
- HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor
- Breadboard
- Jumper Wires
- 9V Battery or USB Power Supply

## Circuit Diagram

The circuit was created and simulated in Tinkercad.

## Arduino Code

The Arduino sketch is located in the `code/` folder and can be uploaded to an Arduino Uno using the Arduino IDE.


## Tinkercad Simulation

This project can be explored and simulated online using Tinkercad Circuits.
